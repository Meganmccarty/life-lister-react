# Life-Lister - React Frontend

This is the React frontend for the Life-Lister app. This app enables naturalists to keep track of the organisms they have seen and share their life lists with others. The backend is built with Ruby on Rails. For the backend, see the repo here: https://github.com/Meganmccarty/life-lister-rails

You can also watch a [short walkthrough video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1RuurazEz0-hyKefSAGRFzVUufP_LjMcS/view?usp=sharing) of the project.
